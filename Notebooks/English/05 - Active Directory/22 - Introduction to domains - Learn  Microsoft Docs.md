You can add custom domain names to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). After you add the domain names, your employees can use memorable and branded usernames to access your company's resources.

Your organization used Azure to develop and test a pilot project. It has now decided to make Azure available to the entire company. You're the organization's Global Administrator in Azure AD. You're going to set up accounts for all your employees.

You want to create usernames that are familiar to your users. Their Azure sign-in names need to be memorable. Also, their Azure AD accounts should clearly be associated with your organization. You have a new custom domain name that your organization bought from a domain name registrar. Before you create the user accounts, you want to add your organization's custom domain name to Azure AD.

This module explains how Azure AD supports custom domain names and shows how to add them. The final unit discusses some common problems you might see and how to solve them.
