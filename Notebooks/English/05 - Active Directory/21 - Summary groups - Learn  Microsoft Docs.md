Azure Active Directory is the hub for user management in the cloud. It provides a single-sign on capability that makes it easier to onboard new employees and ensure you remove access from previous employees. It integrates tightly with your on-premises Windows Server Active Directory so you have a seamless login experience across all your local and cloud-based resources, and it integrates with other cloud environments like Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Dropbox, or Google. Finally, it can reduce your IT burden through its centralized management portal, support for self-service password resets, multi-factor authentication for increased security, high-reliability, and support for managing users and groups with roles.
