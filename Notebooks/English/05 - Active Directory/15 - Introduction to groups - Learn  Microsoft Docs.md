Transitioning workloads to the cloud involves more than just moving servers, websites, and data. Companies need to think about how to secure those resources, identify authorized users, and ensure that data accessed, services created, and operations performed by those users is permitted. Security is a complex area and it's easy to get wrong - as shown by the multitude of successful attacks on big companies in the news.

We need to control user access to company data centrally, provide a definitive identity for each user that a company uses for each service, and ensure employees and vendors have _just enough access_ to do their job. When an employee leaves, or a vendors contract is over, ensuring that their access is removed is even more important.

Azure tries to make these sorts of problems easier to solve with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Azure AD is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service which provides single sign-on and multi-factor authentication to help protect your users from 99.9 percent of cybersecurity attacks.
